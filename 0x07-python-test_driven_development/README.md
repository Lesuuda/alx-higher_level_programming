## Introduction

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. The cycle typically involves writing a test, running it (which should fail initially), implementing the code to pass the test, and finally, refactoring the code. This iterative process helps ensure that the code is reliable, maintainable, and meets the specified requirements.

This repository serves as a learning resource for TDD in Python. It includes examples, exercises, and projects to help developers grasp the concepts and techniques of TDD.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x07-python-test_driven_development.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x07-python-test_driven_development
   ```

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `tests/`: Contains test modules for different parts of the codebase.
- `/`: contains the python source code

Feel free to explore each directory for specific content related to TDD.

## How to Run Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

This command will discover and run all tests within the `tests/` directory.
