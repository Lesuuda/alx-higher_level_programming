# 0x0C-Python-almost_a_circle

## Overview

This project is designed to reinforce and expand our understanding of Python by covering a wide range of topics. Through the implementation and testing of classes and functionalities related to geometrical shapes, we will delve into key aspects of Python programming. The primary focus areas include:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file

Additionally, the project provides an opportunity to explore more advanced concepts such as:

- args and kwargs
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0C-Python-almost_a_circle.git
    cd 0x0C-Python-almost_a_circle
    ```

2. Review the project structure and files.

3. Start implementing the required functionalities according to the project requirements.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific aspect of Python programming. Key directories include:

- **models**: Contains the main classes for the geometrical shapes.
- **tests**: Includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionalities.
- **main_files**: Consists of files to demonstrate the usage of the implemented classes and functions.
- **serialization**: Covers serialization and deserialization functionalities using JSON.

## Key Concepts

### Classes

- The project involves the creation of classes to represent different geometrical shapes.
- Classes make use of private attributes, and getters/setters are implemented to access and modify these attributes securely.

### Inheritance

- The concept of inheritance is explored to create a hierarchy of classes, building upon the properties of the base class.

### Unit Testing

- Unittests are provided to verify the correctness of the implemented functionalities, ensuring robust code.

### File Operations

- Read and write operations are performed to and from files, enhancing your file handling skills in Python.

### Advanced Concepts

- Args and kwargs are utilized to handle variable numbers of arguments in functions.
- Serialization and deserialization functionalities are implemented, using JSON to encode and decode Python objects.
