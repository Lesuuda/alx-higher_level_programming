**Project Title: Python - Network #0**

## Overview
This project focuses on learning the basics of networking and HTTP using Python. It covers making HTTP requests, understanding HTTP response codes, dealing with headers, and more. This README serves as a guide to understanding the structure and purpose of the project.

## Prerequisites
Before running the scripts in this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- curl (optional for comparison purposes)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Explore the contents:
   - **0-hbtn_status.sh**: Bash script to make an HTTP GET request to a given URL and display the body of the response.
   - **1-hbtn_header.sh**: Bash script to make an HTTP GET request to a given URL and display the value of a specific header.
   - **2-post_email.sh**: Bash script to make an HTTP POST request with data from a file and display the body of the response.
   - **3-methods.sh**: Bash script to display all HTTP methods the server will accept for a given URL.
   - **4-header.sh**: Bash script to make an HTTP GET request with a custom header and display the body of the response.
   - **5-post_params.sh**: Bash script to make an HTTP POST request with parameters and display the body of the response.
   - **6-peak.py**: Python script to find a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

## Usage
1. To run the Bash scripts, simply execute them in your terminal, providing any necessary arguments.
   ```
   ./0-hbtn_status.sh
   ```

2. To run the Python script, use the following command:
   ```
   python3 6-peak.py
   ```
