## Description

This project, `0x0E-SQL_more_queries`, is an extension of the SQL introduction, covering more advanced queries and scenarios. It builds upon the foundational concepts introduced earlier, diving into more complex SQL statements and database operations.

Topics covered include:
- Subqueries and nested queries
- Aggregate functions and grouping
- Joins and relationships between tables
- Indexing and optimization techniques
- Advanced data manipulation with UPDATE and DELETE statements

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this project, ensure that you have completed the prerequisites from the `0x0D-SQL-Introduction` project. Additionally, make sure you have a solid understanding of basic SQL concepts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lesuuda/alx-higher_level_programming.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 0x0E-SQL_more_queries
    ```

3. [Optional] If using a specific SQL server, modify the connection details in the scripts accordingly.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run and explore the advanced SQL queries:

1. Execute the SQL scripts in numerical order (e.g., `01-subqueries.sql`, `02-aggregate-functions.sql`, etc.) to explore different aspects of advanced SQL.

2. Review the comments within each script for explanations and additional information.

3. Experiment with modifying the queries to test your understanding of the concepts.
