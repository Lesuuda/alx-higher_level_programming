# 0x0A Python Inheritance

This directory contains Python scripts and programs related to the topic of inheritance in Python. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass or parent class). This enhances code reusability and helps in creating a logical structure for your code.

## Introduction

Understanding inheritance is crucial for building scalable and maintainable code in Python. This repository serves as a resource to explore and practice various concepts related to inheritance, including superclass, subclass, method overriding, and multiple inheritance.

## Content

The repository includes the following:

1. **Superclass.py**: Contains an example of a basic superclass with attributes and methods.
2. **Subclass.py**: Demonstrates how to create a subclass that inherits from the superclass and may override its methods.
3. **MultipleInheritance.py**: Shows an example of a class inheriting from multiple base classes.
4. **MethodOverride.py**: Illustrates how to override methods inherited from a base class in a subclass.
5. **TypeChecking.py**: Demonstrates the use of `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions.

## How to Use

To use and explore the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lesuuda/alx-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x0A-python-inheritance
   ```

3. Run the Python scripts using the Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python Superclass.py
   ```

   Replace `Superclass.py` with the desired script name.
