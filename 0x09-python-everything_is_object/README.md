# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Description

This project covers the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, emphasizing the fact that everything in Python is an object. It explores various aspects of objects, classes, and their attributes and methods.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.
- Explore the concept of objects and instances.
- Learn about classes, attributes, and methods.
- Differentiate between public, protected, and private attributes.
- Implement class methods and static methods.
- Explore special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, and `__del__`.
- Understand the role of properties, getters, and setters.
- Comprehend data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding.
- Investigate the `__dict__` attribute of a class and an instance.
- Discover class attributes and their differences from object attributes.
- Dynamically create new attributes for existing instances.
- Gain insights into the `getattr` function and its usage.
