## Introduction to Classes

Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow you to model real-world entities and define their behavior through attributes and methods.

## Defining Classes

Learn how to define a class in Python, including the basic syntax and structure.

```python
class ClassName:
    # Class content here
```

## Class Attributes

Understand how to use class attributes to store data shared by all instances of a class.

```python
class Example:
    class_attribute = "Shared Value"
```

## Instance Attributes

Explore instance attributes, which are unique to each instance of a class.

```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self, instance_attribute):
        self.instance_attribute = instance_attribute
```

## Methods

Define methods within a class to encapsulate functionality.

```python
class Example:
    def some_method(self):
        # Method implementation
```

## Constructors

Learn about constructors (`__init__` method) and how they are used to initialize object attributes.

```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self, attribute):
        self.attribute = attribute
```

## Inheritance

Discover how to create a hierarchy of classes through inheritance.

```python
class ParentClass:
    # Parent class content

class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # Child class content
```

## Encapsulation

Understand encapsulation and how to use private and protected attributes.

```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected_attribute = "Protected"
        self.__private_attribute = "Private"
```

## Polymorphism

Explore polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"
```

## Class and Static Methods

Learn about class methods and static methods, which operate on the class itself rather than instances.

```python
class Example:
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        # Class method implementation

    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        # Static method implementation
```

## Property Decorators

Understand property decorators to create getter, setter, and deleter methods.

```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self._value = None

    @property
    def value(self):
        return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        self._value = new_value

    @value.deleter
    def value(self):
        del self._value
```
