## Description

This project is an introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language), covering fundamental concepts and basic queries. It is designed to provide a foundational understanding of how to interact with relational databases using SQL.

Topics covered include:
- Creating databases and tables
- Inserting, updating, and deleting data
- Retrieving data using SELECT statements
- Filtering and sorting data
- Joining tables for more complex queries

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) database server
- A SQL client (e.g., [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), or the command line for MySQL or SQLite)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lesuuda/alx-higher_level_programming.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 0x0D-SQL-Introduction
    ```

3. [Optional] If using a specific SQL server, modify the connection details in the scripts accordingly.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run and explore the SQL introduction scripts:

1. Execute the SQL scripts in numerical order (e.g., `01-create-database.sql`, `02-create-table.sql`, etc.) to set up the database and tables.

2. Run the SELECT queries to retrieve and manipulate data. Feel free to modify the queries to experiment with different scenarios.

3. Refer to the comments within each script for explanations and additional information.
